# Molecular modeling with Heme  

Heme is an implementation of force-field based molecular modeling 
in the Rust language. It's a work in progress that's helping me 
learn Rust. I hope that it will eventually be useful, but right now
it's not. (For good implementations of force-field based molecular
modeling, see FoldX or Lumol.)
