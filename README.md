# Heme is a molecular modeling toolkit 

`heme` reads molecular structures from the command line and generates features. 
*Heme* is compatible with a variety of scoring functions. *Heme* includes a molecular 
mechanics force field implemented in Rust. *Heme* can be used to model protein 
structures using full-atom scoring functions and output features useful for 
machine learning
